# **AI Based chess engine**

A Python-based chess engine with a graphical interface using Pygame, featuring basic move validation, piece selection, and an AI opponent (coming soon). This project is a personal learning endeavor into game development, artificial intelligence, and Python.



# **Project Overview**

This is a chess engine developed using Python. The aim is to:

1. Create a functional GUI for the chessboard and pieces
2. Implement legal move validation
3. Add turn-based mechanics
4. Develop a basic AI for automated moves
5. Explore search algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning (future scope).
