AI Based chess engine
A Python-based chess engine with a graphical interface using Pygame, featuring basic move validation, piece selection, and an AI opponent (coming soon). This project is a personal learning endeavor into game development, artificial intelligence, and Python.


Project Overview
This is a chess engine developed using Python. The aim is to:
Create a functional GUI for the chessboard and pieces
Implement legal move validation
Add turn-based mechanics
Develop a basic AI for automated moves
Explore search algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning (future scope).
